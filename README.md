# Video_Game_Analysis
This project works for the company Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. We identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not.


We are planning for 2017 sales in order to make predictions on what games and platforms will be the most advantageous to focus on.


The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.
